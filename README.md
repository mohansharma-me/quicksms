QuickSMS software allow its user to prepare batch of messages to be sent over GSM-enabled modem, easily and efficiently with delivery reports and proper contacts management.

I developed software while working at WebcodeZ Infoway. This software is intended to send bulk messages using any telco company simcard through gsm-modem (dongle) to bypass the gateway restrictions.

It provides proper contacts management, import/export details, delivery reports etcâ€¦
